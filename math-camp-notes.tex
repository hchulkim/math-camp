\textbf{Important notes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Due to housing issue, I might have to miss the first day.
	\item Due to this problem, I will be manually studying for about 5 to 6 subsections using the notes given by the instructor.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Some Exercises}\\

\noindent Exercise 1.3.11: Why such partition exists only for equivalence relation? Are all three properties required for existence of such partition?

\begin{proof}
	car
\end{proof}

\noindent Exercise 1.3.20: Let's define a binary relation $R$ on $\N$ in a following way: $xR y$ if $y$ is divisible by $x$. Is this relation a partial order, a total order or it is not order at all?

\begin{proof}
	car
\end{proof}

\noindent Exercise 1.4.10: Define a bijection in a similar way (using preimages). 

\begin{proof}
	car
\end{proof}

\noindent Exercise 1.4.11: Show that $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ both are bijections, then $g \cdot f: X \to Z$ is a bijection too.

\begin{proof}
	car
\end{proof}

\noindent Exercise 1.4.15: $f: X \to Y$  has an inverse if and only if it is a bijection.

\begin{proof}
	car
\end{proof}
